# AI Mood Board
An AI based application and pen combination that allowes the user to create mood boards at home or on the go to build a creative project. 
## Summary
The application will optimize the users ability to curate, visualize and plan a variety of creative projects through image recognition and suggest related / similar options for the user to choose from. For example, interior designers can utilize the application for curating home design options including colours, textiles, materials and furniture. 
## Background
### General Description
A mood board is a visual tool that helps layout ideas and concepts and is often associated with interior design or wedding planning. The user selects items that help communicate the overall vision, and use it as inspiration towards a personal or shared goal. With the help of AI and image recognition, the application will allow the user to scan or select items that can be added to a digital mood board. The application will scan the image and find similar images that may interest the user based on their submission and can suggest items that are similar such as complimentary colours, materials, companion plants, etc., to help the user plan and create the project of their choosing. The application with pen attachment will work for on-the-go meetings with clients to quickly scan colours and items for identification and planning purposes. The mood board aims to:
* Learn about the interests of the user / client based on a series of questions populated by the user or by the app, depending on use
* Scan and identify a variety of items such as paint colours, textiles, materials, furniture, plants, fixtures, clothing, etc.
* Suggest complimentary items based on already selected items, as well as identify where to purchase the items, the cost, and availability with options to add the item to a cart
* Share the mood board with community members to inspire other projects / help the application build a repository of like-minded searches and projects.
## How is it used?
The application has two modules: 1) personal use and 2) commercial/business use
* **Personal Use** is for users that are creating mood boards for personal use, such as home renovations, wedding planning, garden planning, etc., and includes a simplified mood board for the user to customize the layout, project type, and add desired items of their choosing. The personal use module is pre-loaded with basic questions to help the user establish a project plan and get started. 
* **Commercial / Business Use** is for users that plan to meet with clients and build portfolios such as interior designers, wedding planners, landscape architects, project managers, entrepreneurs, etc. The commerical / business use module allows the user to customize questions to ask clients such as preferred colours, styles, budgets, etc., and curate a more individualized mood board based on the specific project.
Both personal and commercial/business use modules are compatible with the pen attachment
## Data sources and AI methods
The data is inputted by the user when starting the application and uses image recognition to identify and find similar / related items. The information collected grows as the user uses the application and is classified as a specific item type. Using AI methods, the application will identify corresponding pictures, complimentary colors, etc, that best match with the initial image. When a match is made, the application will record the "win" and be able to match that item with future items for other users. The effectiveness and efficiency of the classification will depend on the image bank, the identified matches, and categorization of like-things to produce a mood board that covers the project objectives. 
## Challenges
The application will require a large amount of images that are labelled with alternative text in order to be effective and produce matches to the initial image. If a user flags an image as a match, but it doesn't match for another user, it could create challenges in the effectiveness of the app in producing mood boards with limited searching. There is also challenges that the application may not recognize an image in which case the user could add details about what the image is. 
## What next?
This project requires further planning to develop the data model in detail, determine if there are like apps that may present a oopyright issue, create data testing to determine the effectiveness of the app, and ultimately develop a prototype.
